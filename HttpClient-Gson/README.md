Android-HttpClient Gson module
===============================

A module for HttpClient that uses [gson][1] to parse the data received from HTTP.
Like the other `InputStreamParser` they can be used [synchronously](../HttpClient) or [asynchronously](../HttpClient-Async).

Sample Code
-----------

```java
class MyClass {
	@SerializedName("id") int id;
	@SerializedName("name") String name;
}

HttpRequestGet request = new HttpRequestGet("https://api.com/1/test.json");

// Create a parser for MyClass using Gson
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().create();
InputStreamGsonParser<MyClass> parser = new InputStreamGsonParser<MyClass>(gson, MyClass.class);

// query the data from the server directly in the form of an object of class MyClass
MyClass dlInstance = HttpClient.parseRequest(request, parser);
```
